   The Story of the To-Do List Manager

Every day, Mia had many things to do—homework, meetings, shopping, and more. But there was a problem. She kept forgetting important tasks because she wrote them on random papers or tried to remember them in her head.

*"I need a better way to keep track of my tasks!"* she thought.

So, Mia decided to create **The To-Do List Manager**—a simple tool to help her stay organized. Her system would allow her to:

✅ **Add new tasks** whenever she needed.

✅ **Remove tasks** once they were done.

✅ **See all her tasks** in one clear list.

With a plan in mind, she started building her perfect to-do list. Would this system help Mia stay organized and never forget a task again? That was up to her…

   ## Flow building To-Do List Manager
 
   1. Problem Analysis
      - Hard to track tasks

   2. Decomposition
      Components:
      - Input task
      - Task storage
      - Remove function when task is done
      - See all tasks

   3. Pattern Recognition 

      // TODO: 
       1. Similar Problems
          ▢ What existing solutions are similar?
          ▢ What patterns can we reuse?
          ▢ What common problems might we face?

       2. Common Operations
          ▢ Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD)
          ▢ Input/Process/Output
          ▢ Store/Retrieve
