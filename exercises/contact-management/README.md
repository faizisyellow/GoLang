 The Story of the Contact Keeper

Alex had a problem. He had too many names and phone numbers written in different places—some in his notebook, some on his phone, and some in messages. When he needed to find someone’s contact, it took too long.

*"I need a better way to save and find my contacts!"* he thought.

So, Alex decided to build **The Contact Keeper**—a simple system to help him stay organized. His system would allow him to:

✅ **Add new contacts** with a name, phone number, and email.

✅ **See all contacts** in one place.

✅ **Search for a contact** by name quickly.

He wasn’t sure how to start, but he knew he had to find the best way to organize and manage his contacts. With the right approach, he believed he could solve his problem.

Would Alex succeed in building his perfect Contact Keeper? That was up to him…
